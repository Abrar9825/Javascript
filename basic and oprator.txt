 document.write : is like a printf means print a any value on browers so we can use document.write..
 console.log: is used for print a value in console..
 var : is used for all program asa global varible..
 let : is used for public varible it's only used in function not a out side function..
 const:is uniqly identify in program we can't use again in our program and also we can't change the value of const varible..
 data type:(primitive)->number,string,boolean,undifined,null..
 data type:(non-primitive)->array,object..
 data type:(null)->when we represnt a null in our program it's represnt like a object it's object not a null..
 oprator : in this javascript we have the 8 type of oprator 
 1.arithmatic
 2.assighment
 3.string
 4.condtinol
 5.logical
 6.Bitwise
 7.comprison
 8.typeof 

1. arithmatic oprator : +,-,*,/,%,++,--  this are the arithmatic oprator
 and which value we are use to do this called as oprand like a+b in this example a and b is oprand..

2. assighment oprator : =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=,^=,|=,**= this are the assighment oprator
and which value we are use to do this called as oprand like a+b in this example a and b is oprand..
in assighment oprand whatever the value in right side it's assign the value of left side like example
a=10 in this case 10 is the right side value and it's store or asign to left side varible means a it's also called short hend oprand in a normal time we use addtion like this a=a+10 and using a assighment oprand we use like a+=10..

3.string oprator: +,+= is use for sum of string like one string is hello and second is world sum of both string is hello world using + oprator..

4.condtinol oprator : is also called a turnury oprator is use for check this given condtion is true or false 

5.logical oprator : &&,||,! in this condtion the it's return a boolean means true or false
->&& oprator return when the both condtion are true
->|| oprand return when || if any one 
->! it's make a oposite the condtion when condtionis true is return false
 
6.Bitwise:the Bitwise oprator is &,|,~,^
used to check condtion using binary number ex.binary number of 5 is 0101 and 1 is 0001 and then we are using & oprator mens 1 condtion is false then answer is false and it's work as soon as 

7.comprison oprator:==,===,!=,!==,>,<,>=,<= this are the comprison oprator it' return a boolean means true or false

8.typeof:it's check a typeof oprand and oprator like a number or string ext..

-> assocativti : there is two type of assocativti right-to-left,left-to-right..
the + oprator has assocativti left-to-right
->in this case which type of oprator first the whole line is act like a first oprand or oprator like example
the all oprand value is 10; 
we are use a+b+"hello"+c+d in this case output is 20hello1010  so this case a+b is 20 and after string it's consider string so print as it is
